------------------------------------------------------
Clip Master is an AI-powered web-based application for processing video content through a pipeline that includes audio extraction, AI-driven transcription, text summarization, and an interactive Q&A system. Users can input a YouTube URL or a local video file path via a Streamlit UI. The application uses yt-dlp to download and extract audio from online videos or FFmpeg for local files. Whisper AI then transcribes the audio into text. The text is summarized using NLP techniques to power a Q&A bot for interactive engagement.
